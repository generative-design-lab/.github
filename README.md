## About the organization

The Generative Design Lab is part of the Inistute of Structural Mechanics and Design at the Technical University of Darmstadt. We research generative and additive manufacturing technologies for use in construction. Our focus is on process and product development. Research areas include 3D printing of glass, steel, ceramics and paper. Research results include customized nodes for facade systems, free-form bricks for functionalized masonry, 3D paper structures for use as acoustic absorbers, and complex but fully transparent glass structures.
